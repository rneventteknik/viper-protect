# Viper Protect

A project to create a light that shows if our mac vipers have had time to cool down before you turn off power to them

## Usage
The easiest way to run this by using micro pico to upload the code to a raspberry pi micro-w. The vscode project is alreaddy set up for that workflow.

To be able to run this code you need to have a file called `wifinamepass.py` containing the following snippet
```Python
wifi_name = "<your ssid>"
wifi_pass = "<your wifi pass>"
```
